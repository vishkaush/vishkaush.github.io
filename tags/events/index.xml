      <description>&lt;p&gt;Attended the All India Heads of Police Communication conference held at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi on 19th and 20th November 2018. I was one of the delegates representing NCETIS (National Center of Excellence in Technology for Internal Security), IITB and was there to showcase some of the product prototypes we have developed to the heads of police from across several states. It was an awesome conference to be a part of.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Three days with the Indian Army</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is quite happening to pursue PhD at IITB. Here is an example. In the capacity of a research assistant I work on several projects with my PhD advisor, Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan. One of the projects, &lt;em&gt;SurakshaVyuha&lt;/em&gt; is about detecting certain events of interest in real-time from the live feeds coming from surveillance cameras. To demonstrate the prototype developed and to further understand the requirements from the horse&amp;rsquo;s mouth, I and my advisor went to an army location near the LoC (&lt;strong&gt;yes, the LoC!&lt;/strong&gt;). This was in December 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my first experience (and I must say only one of its kind) to stay in one of the brigade head quarters getting to interact with the officers as well as jawans posted there. I was really impressed with their hospitality. Their discipline, their comradry, their organization, their endurance, and above all, their spirit - all par excellence. Came back with a lot of respect for our army in my heart than ever before. &lt;strong&gt;Jai Hind!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If you are interested in deep learning in general and in deep learning for computer vision in particular, do checkout this &lt;a href=&#34;http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/summerschool/resources.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;wonderful compilation of available resources&lt;/a&gt;.
