With this I become the first one to present in this group. What could have been a better choice than something hot off the press from CVPR 2016? YOLO\u0026rsquo;s claim to fame is that it is the most accurate real-time object detector and is also the fastest object detector in literature today. Hit the PDF button on the top-left of this page and enjoy the slides.\nFollowup after talk:\nI have added a slide towards the end containing the questions (from the session) that could potentially provide further directions for research. I have also explicitly elaborated on the various terms in the multi-part loss function that YOLO uses.\nBelow are some of the questions (and answers) from the session for quick reference.\n If there is a unique mapping between a grid cell and the object it is center of, do we really need four parameters, x, y, w and h? A: Yes, because given a grid cell, the bounding boxes that it predicts could be anywhere and of any size. x and y marks the center of the bounding box, relative to the grid cell (normalized as an offset between 0 and 1)\n How could a prior probably be modeled in the loss function? A: Good question. Included in last slide for further investigation.\n Any studies on depth perception in images? A: Good question. Included in last slide for further investigation. This perhaps good give clues for good prior as well!\n YOLO claims to generalize well to other domains but has tested itself only for person detection in artworks! Who knows it didn\u0026rsquo;t do well in other domains? A: Yes, you never know ;)\n How is NIN a substitute for inception architecture used by GoogleNet? A: Good question. Included in last slide for further investigation.\n Would YOLO do well if in the same object portions of that object are also labelled as the whole? For example, face of the dog labeled as \u0026ldquo;dog\u0026rdquo; and the whole body also labeled as \u0026ldquo;dog\u0026rdquo; in the same image for the same dog A: It does detect any object appearing in different forms. Plus it does label objects inside objects. Given these two I believe there is no reason YOLO will not do well on the question asked.\n Non Max Supression and Thresholding are post-processing steps? A: I am not sure if i answered this as no. I goofed up if I did so. The answer to this question has to be yes, as the output, as we discussed, is a complete tensor with info about all boxes, hence calling for a post processing step (which is quick and doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any optimization as against the separate optimization required in R-CNN for adjusting the bounding boxes).\n YOLO 9000 jointly optimizes classification and detection. Isn\u0026rsquo;t YOLO doing the same by eliminating that complex pipeline? A: No. YOLO is only bothered about detection and is modeling that as an end-to-end regression problem. The effect of classification is getting implicitly created by the CNN. YOLO 9000 on the other hand has the ability to jointly train on classification data and detection data. Quoting them, \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; uses images labelled for detection to learn detection-specific information like bounding box coordinate prediction and objectness as well as how to classify common objects. It uses images with only class labels to expand the number of categories it can detect\u0026rdquo;.\n What is multi-scale training? A: Making a network robust to running on images of different sizes by training this aspect into the model. YOLO 9000 implements this. They argue that since their model only uses convolutional and pooling layers it can be resized on the fly. They change the network every few iterations. Every 10 batches their network randomly chooses a new image dimension size. This technique forces the network to learn to predict well across a variety of input dimensions.\n Have they said anything about the choice of S? A: No. They have used S=7 for their experiments but have not commented on how they got that number.\n Thought process behind their network architecture? A: Not revealed by them except for the fact that it is inspired by GoogLeNet.\n  ","date":1484125209,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1484125209,"objectID":"a4d509775a906d22afe469b646038237","permalink":"https://vishkaush.github.io/talk/yolo/","publishdate":"2017-01-11T14:30:09+05:30","relpermalink":"/talk/yolo/","section":"talk","summary":"Gave a talk today in the Machine Learning reading group of CSE@IITB.

I am not sure whether anybody really read it or not, but I really meant what I wrote :)\nStatement of Purpose (SOP) for admission to the PhD Programme in Computer Science \u0026amp; Engineering at IIT Bombay in the field of Machine Learning/Data Mining/Data Analytics\n\u0026ldquo;The role of brain in a human body can never be overstated. Similar, in my opinion, is the role of the intelligentsia in the society. I strongly believe that the best brains in the world should be contributing to the field of research and education and in this way make a tangible contribution to the society. Though I do not claim to be among the best brains in the world, but as an illustrious alumnus of IIT Kharagpur, with numerous awards and achievements to my credit (including the Institute Silver Medal for being the topper at IIT Kharagpur, Star Award for outstanding performance at BMC Software, “VIT Shri” Awards at Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune for being the best teacher) I certainly can compete with them and thus have a strong urge to contribute, especially in areas like governance and security which can have a tremendous impact on society.\nI have done my BTech in CSE from IIT Kharagpur in 2004 after which I worked for six years in Oracle, Bangalore and then for about two years in BMC Software, Pune. The fruit of these eight years in industry came in the form of a calling - to work for a cause bigger than myself. Not wanting to leave Pune, I joined Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Engineering. This was my first step towards returning back to academia. Vishwakarma Institute of Technology is an autonomous college affiliated with University of Pune and is among the premiere colleges in Maharashtra. Because of the need of the hour at that time, I had to pursue my MTech from the same college. People say I am a perfectionist. I agree. Whatever I do, I like to give myself completely to it. Coupled with God\u0026rsquo;s grace, this has turned out to be a great combination so far. Thus during my MTech also I secured first rank in the department as well as in the institute.\nNow after four years of observing the academia closely, I find myself prepared and geared up for taking the next step, which is of pursuing PhD from IIT Bombay. Being a graduate from IIT Kharagpur, doing MTech from Pune University was a situational compromise for me, but I do not have any such constraints right now. Not only IIT Bombay is close to my home at Pune, being one of the best and most sought after institute in the country, it is my destination of choice and I want to leave no stone unturned to be given an opportunity here to prove my mettle.\nMy MTech work was about automatically recognizing user personality from Facebook status updates. I have been working in the area of Data Analytics for a couple of years now (have a couple of publications and have guided several major projects). My projects have included topics like “automated rating in web applications using collective intelligence”, “creating ACO and PSO based classification and clustering modules in Weka”, “group recommendation and community detection in Facebook”, “ask answer service on Facebook” and a few others. I have now developed a strong affinity for Data Analytics, especially its intersection with Machine Learning. Together they have a potential to change the way we live, for better. Working on real world problems which can touch the lives of people is what excites me and I look forward to working on such problems during my PhD.

Blood is arguably one of the most important things in our body, yet we do not realize its presence/value unless we start losing it. Much the same way, culture is a vital element of the social fabric, but we do not realize its value unless we see the effects of its degradation. In this connection, several years back I had come across this post and would like to share it again here:\nI hope this catches YOU the way it caught me!\nIn light of the many perversions and jokes we send along to one another for a laugh, this is a little different: This joke today is not intended to be a joke, it\u0026rsquo;s not intended to be funny, it\u0026rsquo;s intended to get you thinking.\nA prominent American\u0026rsquo;s daughter was interviewed on the Early Show and Jane Clayson asked her \u0026ldquo;How could God let something like this happen?\u0026rdquo; (Regarding the attacks on September 11)\nAnne Graham gave an extremely profound and insightful response. She said, \u0026ldquo;I believe God is deeply saddened by this, just as we are, but for years we\u0026rsquo;ve been telling God to get out of our schools, to get out of our government and to get out of our lives. And being the gentleman He is,I believe He has calmly backed out. How can we expect God to give us His blessing and His protection if we demand He leave us alone?\u0026rdquo;\nIn light of recent events\u0026hellip;terrorists attack, school shootings, etc, I think it started when Madeleine Murray O\u0026rsquo;Hare (she was murdered, her body found recently) complained she didn\u0026rsquo;t want prayer in our schools, and we said OK. Then someone said you better not read the Bible in school\u0026hellip;the Bible says thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, and love your neighbor as yourself.\nAnd we said OK.\nThen Dr. Benjamin Spock said we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t spank our children when they misbehave because their little personalities would be warped and we might damage their self-esteem (Dr. Spock\u0026rsquo;s son committed suicide). We said an expert should know what he\u0026rsquo;s talking about.\nAnd we said OK.\nThen someone said teachers and principals better not discipline our children when they misbehave. The school administrators said no faculty member in this school better touch a student when they misbehave because we don\u0026rsquo;t want any bad publicity, and we surely don\u0026rsquo;t want to be sued (there\u0026rsquo;s a big difference between disciplining, touching, beating, smacking, humiliating, kicking, etc.)\nAnd we said OK.\nThen someone said, let\u0026rsquo;s let our daughters have abortions if they want, and they won\u0026rsquo;t even have to tell their parents.\nAnd we said OK.\nThen some wise school board member said, since boys will be boys and they\u0026rsquo;re going to do it anyway, let\u0026rsquo;s give our sons all the condoms they want so they can have all the fun they desire, and we won\u0026rsquo;t have to tell their parents they got them at school.\nAnd we said OK.\nThen some of our top elected officials said it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what we do in private as long as we do our jobs. Agreeing with them, we said it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter to me what anyone, including the President, does in private as long as I have a job and the economy is good.\nThen someone said let\u0026rsquo;s print magazines with pictures of nude women and call it wholesome, down-to-earth appreciation for the beauty of the female body.\nAnd we said OK.\nAnd then someone else took that appreciation a step further and published pictures of nude children and then further again by making them available on the Internet.\nAnd we said OK, they\u0026rsquo;re entitled to free speech.\nThen the entertainment industry said, let\u0026rsquo;s make TV shows and movies that promote profanity, violence, and illicit sex. Let\u0026rsquo;s record music that encourages rape, drugs, murder, suicide, and satanic themes. And we said it\u0026rsquo;s just entertainment, it has no adverse effect, nobody takes it seriously anyway, so go right ahead.\nNow we\u0026rsquo;re asking ourselves why our children have no conscience, why they don\u0026rsquo;t know right from wrong, and why it doesn\u0026rsquo;t bother them to kill strangers, their classmates, and themselves.\nProbably, if we think about it long and hard enough, we can figure it out!\nIt has a great deal to do with \u0026ldquo;WE REAP WHAT WE SOW.\u0026rdquo;\nFunny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world\u0026rsquo;s going to hell. Funny how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what the Bible says.\nFunny how you can send \u0026lsquo;jokes\u0026rsquo; through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice about sharing. Funny how lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene articles pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion of God is suppressed in the school and workplace.\nAre you laughing?\nFunny how when you forward this message, you will not send it to many on your address list because you\u0026rsquo;re not sure what they believe, or what they will think of you for sending it.\nFunny how we can be more worried about what other people think of us than what God thinks of us.\nPass it on if you think it has merit. If not then just discard it\u0026hellip; No one will know you did. But, if you discard this thought process, don\u0026rsquo;t sit back and complain about what bad shape the world is in!\nAre you thinking?\n","date":1449490241,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1449490241,"objectID":"0dc81b0c225a05e2c7135d5ce36f0cc7","permalink":"https://vishkaush.github.io/post/are-you-thinking/","publishdate":"2015-12-07T17:40:41+05:30","relpermalink":"/post/are-you-thinking/","section":"post","summary":"It is said, \u0026ldquo;culture is like blood\u0026rdquo;.

This gap can be minimized by understanding what the industry expects from a fresh engineer. This article is an attempt to list out the top 8 expectations industries have from an engineer.\n Learnability: The fluid industry trends in today’s world force engineers to be life-long learners! Learnability is the ability to generalize a specific knowledge and apply in various contexts. Industries expect engineers to have the zest and zeal along with the ability to learn new tools and techniques.\n Ability to work in teams: Individualism is out and collaboration is in. Considering the options we have in today’s global village, it is impossible for one to master all the skills that are needed for an industry. One should have the ability to identify one’s core skills, team up with members with complementary skills, collaborate and contribute.\n Communication Skills: An organization expects all the employees to communicate effectively. Engineers should have good verbal and written communication skills. This is a skill that is absolutely necessary when working in teams where inappropriate communication could be disastrous. Most of the industries in India have adopted English as the language of communication considering the diverse nature of their clients and workforce.\n Positive Attitude: The importance of positive attitude for a successful career cannot be overemphasized. When something goes wrong, one can either blame one’s circumstances or look at ways of making the situation better. Industry wants the latter category who considers such a situation as an opportunity to learn.\n Flexibility: Many organizations, especially those in the software industry, give a lot of flexibility to the employees. At the same time those industries expect the employees also to be flexible in terms of working location, nature of projects or in some cases, working hours.\n Adaptability: An engineer should have the ability to adapt to any situation. 100% of the tasks assigned to an engineer may not be in alignment with his or her interest. If 70% of the tasks are interesting, an engineer should be able to adapt to the rest 30%. If one could not find interest even in 70% of the tasks allocated, chances are that one has chosen a wrong career!\n Self-Motivation: Even though a fresh engineer is at the beginning of the career, the industry expects the engineer to be clear about his or her short-term and long-term career plans. One can make a remarkable difference by chalking out one’s career plans. Having a clear idea of what one wants keeps one motivated.\n Ownership: An engineer should own a task that is assigned to him or her. An engineer should leave his or her mark in every product delivered by him or her. The sense of ownership results in completion of tasks with maximum quality.\n  ","date":1438775797,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1438775797,"objectID":"08d0d48500d138b9ce48300598e1099c","permalink":"https://vishkaush.github.io/post/industry-expectations-engineer/","publishdate":"2015-08-05T17:26:37+05:30","relpermalink":"/post/industry-expectations-engineer/","section":"post","summary":"Featured Article: “Industry Expectations from an Engineer” by Rajagopalan P, Infosys, Mysore.\nThe “industry-academia gap” is a widely discussed topic.
